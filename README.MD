A survey React app that measures one's DBI-II score. It can also send the data to an API.

### Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)
The original BDI was published in 1961 by Dr. Aaron T. **Beck** as a way to quickly measure one's depression using a short survey. The questionnaire has undergone many revisions as the field of psychiatry evolved, the most recent one being named BDI-II (from 1996). This current version of the inventory yields a score from 0 to 63, indicating minimal, mild, moderate or severe depression. 

Predictions of suicide-related behaviors, among other behavior patterns, can also be made based on the score.

The BDI-II survey has been translated to 17 different languages, and is widely popular and trusted by psychiatrists in all continents.

### Disclaimer
Please notice that although this app follows the BDI-II specifications, its use alone is not sufficient to reliably diagnose any person with depression. Some unchecked-for factors, such as the emotional-cognitive state of the person during the survey, may significantly distort the final score. Furthermore, the administration of other psychiatric tests over time performed by a professional psychiatrist may also be necessary for an actual diagnosis. Measuring one's BDI-II score may be only one step among many possible others during an effective diagnosis process.

**Self-diagnosing oneself without a proper psychiatric background or the assistance of a medical professional is almost guaranteed to yield an unreliable and significantly misleading result.**
