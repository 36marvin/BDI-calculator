The original BDI was published in 1961 by Dr. Aaron T. Beck as a way to quickly measure one's depression using a short survey (Beck et al., 1961). The questionnaire has undergone many revisions as the field of psychiatry evolved, the most recent one, named BDI-II, being published in  1996 (Beck et al., 1996; Wang, 2013). This current version of the inventory yields a score from 0 to 63, indicating minimal, mild, moderate or severe depression.

The BDI-II survey has been translated to 17 different languages, and is widely popular and trusted by psychiatrists in all continents (Wang, 2013).

### Disclaimer
Please notice that although this app follows the BDI-II specifications, its use alone is not sufficient to reliably diagnose any person with depression. Some unchecked-for factors, such as the emotional-cognitive state of the person during the survey, may significantly distort the final score. Furthermore, the administration of other psychiatric tests over time performed by a professional psychiatrist may also be necessary for an actual diagnosis. Measuring one's BDI-II score may be only one step among many possible others during an effective diagnosis process.

**Self-diagnosing oneself without a proper psychiatric background or the assistance of a medical professional is almost guaranteed to yield an unreliable and significantly misleading result.**
